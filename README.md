# Searchy
🛍️🎁📺🛏️📦💰📗💎

We made this project in 24 hours in Unihack 2018.

The concept is to create a website that compares different online shopping platforms (Amazon, Ebay and Gumtree for now) when user searches for a particular item in the search bar of our website. There will be 3 columns showing top results from each website. Images, names, descriptions, prices and the link will be shown to users for each items. 

There is also a chart showing the average prices for each website for that particular products for good measures for the users. There are different filters for the user to choose from.

Filter includes:
- Cheapest
- Most Expensive
- Most Relevant
- Most Recent

We get the data from the 3 websites by scraping datas and using APIs. Then we will filter the most relevant data and present it to the user on the website.

Users can compare prices and details for each results side by side to minimize their time needed to compare manually.
In future, we plan on comparing other websites as well so that more products could be compared and making the website more user-friendly.

Project made in nodeJS and  HTML.
